This code defines a convolutional neural network (CNN). It has two convolutional layers, two fully connected layers, and two output layers. The first convolutional layer takes in an input image and has 6 output channels. The second convolutional layer has 6 input channels and 12 output channels. The first fully connected layer takes in the output of the second convolutional layer and has 120 output features. The second fully connected layer takes in an input of 10 (a one-hot encoded number) and has 20 output features. The third fully connected layer takes in the concatenation of the output of the two fully connected layers and has 28 output features. The first output layer takes in the output of the third fully connected layer and has 10 output features. The second output layer takes in the output of the third fully connected layer and has 18 output features.
